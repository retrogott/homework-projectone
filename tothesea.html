           <p>Sometimes life goes in a different direction. And out of something “bad” something good can develop or follow.<br>
           This is what happened in Jack’s life.<br>Picking up a camera and waterhousing in March 2016, Jack Noel Davis was introduced to photography after a back injury stopped him from surfing.<br> 
           During his rehab, his camera helped him to reconnect with the ocean and reignite his passion.<br> And his pictures capture the love towards the incredible beauty of the sea in all its facets.</p>

           <h3>I started taking photos in the water in March 2016, so just over a year ago.
                I injured my back pretty badly when I was younger which ultimately stopped me from being able to surf. 
                I love getting in the ocean so the natural progression for me was to pick up a camera and shoot. 
                I invested in a waterhousing and fell in love with the perspective from the water, it´s become quite an obsession since. 
                I’m very thankful that a potentially bad situation yielded a new passion – Silver linings!</h3>

                From my perspective, the photos that evoke emotion are the most powerful and I find that my work that captures a darker mood ultimately evokes more emotion. 
                The photographic work that inspires me has always evoked strong emotion and that’s what I seek to create for others. 
                It’s a constant challenge to progress and produce great work but I love the journey.</h3>

                <h2>On your blog you wrote: One of the biggest problems is in single use plastic products. 
                However, there are simple everyday solutions to help remedy this. Can you tell our readers a few things what they can do to save the ocean.</h2>

                <h3>The ocean has given me so much and I truly believe it is the responsibility of those who love and enjoy the fruits of what the ocean gives to protect it. 
                I believe making small changes in daily plastic consumption is a great way to do your part in keeping the ocean healthy because so much of it ends up in the ocean.
                Single use plastics are a huge issue globally. Making small changes like using a reusable water bottle as well as using KeepCups for take away coffees. 
                Also using reusable tote bags and shopping bags are a great way to substitute traditional single use plastics. Its super affordable and it’d be great to see more people using these alternatives.</h3>
