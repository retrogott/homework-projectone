                <h1>Slow Fashion Tells A Story</h1>
                <p>While each fashion season is getting faster and entire department stores are constantly filled with new goods, 
                the prices get lower and the cupboards are getting fuller and someone or something else pay their own price for all of that.
                But thankfully there are always innovative people and brands, such as Melbourne swimwear label Lou Lou St Cruz who score with recycled and recyclable wonderful pieces.</p>
                <h3>If you want the world to be better then you have to do something for it. Slow fashion is more than a trend. Slow Fashion is about diversity, sustainability, respecting people, 
                animals and nature, resourcefulness and quality. Thoughts that Taryn McLean, the designer behind the Melbourne brand Lou Lou St Cruz has put into action and 
                therefore has become one of the emerging brands that attaches great importance not only to style but also sustainability.</h3>

                <h3>After years-long experience within the fashion world, while working as a European textile buyer, 
                she discovered the benefits of high-performance textiles and the positive impact they can have on the environment. 
                The idea to create an eco-friendly swimwear brand was born after her daughter was born, 
                and her passion and hard work in order to create a positive impact with her fashion just took it all from there.</h3>
                <img src="images/post03/swimwear3.jpg" alt="swimwear melbourne">
                <p>“We believe strongly in the conservation of our oceans, and
                also of reversing the impact of human surplus wherever possible.”</p>
                <h3>Recently Taryn McLean teamed up with Aquafil who are leaders in recycled yarn production, 
                from recycled fishing nets and ocean waste, and one of the first companies in the fashion industry to offer closed loop recycled products. 
                “Our aim is to bring balance to the fashion industry, Swimwear specifically. Our sizes range from 6-16. Fashion can be fickle, 
                it can be alienating and it can damage things, like your confidence, your bank balance and the environment. Whilst we care about all of those things, 
                the one thing we know we can change with the DNA of the brand is the environmental sustainability of the ocean.”</h3>
                <img src="images/post03/swimwear4.jpg" alt="swimwear melbourne">
                <h3>When Lou Lou St Cruz reprocesses the Econyl yarn together with a neo-performance fabric – which is produced in Italy – she makes sure that each piece becomes something that you will love to wear, 
                a trendy yet timeless piece with an amazing design that will last much longer than just a speedy season.</h3>
